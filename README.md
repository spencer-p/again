#### Postmortem notes

I can only vaguely recall what my plan was for this. As it stands, this project just looks like a convoluted way to test walking animations.

I keep this project around for my own reference and also as a backup on the off chance I want to finish this someday.

If you would like to use the sprite, it's all yours. Otherwise there is not much to see here.
